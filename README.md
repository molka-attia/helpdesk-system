# Incident Management System

## Overview

The **Incident Management System** is a robust desktop and mobile application built using the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and **Flutter**. It simplifies incident management by allowing employees to submit and track complaints (tickets) while providing administrators and service teams with comprehensive tools to monitor and resolve incidents efficiently. The system enhances visibility, automates workflows, and tracks technician performance to ensure timely and effective incident handling.
